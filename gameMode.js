// SECOND CONDITION - checks if the ranval length < total questions length
// FINAL CONDITION - if ranval length > total questions, restart using questions
// BONUS - include multiples of the total questions length - currentSet track multiples of that
// BONUS - remove correctly answered questions from the pool

// HINTS - for if your stuck
