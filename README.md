# Japanese-Study-App
# Unit 7: Project 1

## Overview

Welcome to group DMV's project 1 application "The Kanji App". This app is designed for those looking to learn Japanese in a simple and user friendly way. Understanding the Kanji is a very basic stepping stone as an introduction to the language and in this readme you will understand how to navagate and use our app with ease.


## Navagation
navigation of application at top of page/for smaller devices look for dop down menu of links



## Landing Page

The Landing page contains the bulk of what the application has to offer. Starting with the search area you can enter a english word and upon clicking the search button a series of events will occur. There may be an issue with the english word entered due to limitations of the api used(see future features). Information will be dispalyed in 4 seperate areas of the landing page. The upper left box contains the displayed Kanji of english word, the upper right displays an image related to the search term, the lower left has two media inputs; one video for animated strokes to create the kanji and a button containing audio of the pronounceation of kanji, finally the lower right contains search history of kanji's searched.

Future features- We hope to implement a more robust Api resource for our Kanji's as the library currently used is limited

## Game page

The game page contains a mini study game. To begin click the start button and your on your way to a little mind exercise in identifying Kanji's. A large kanji will appear and your job is to guess the correct phrase assoiciated with the Kanji. Upon a correct answer a message will appear telling you you were correct and a score increment increase of 1. The oppopsite will occur if a wrong answer is click and your score will go down by 1. When win condition is met (?)5 correct answers a game over page will be displayed in the left side of the game letting you know what Kanji's you had gotten correct and which ones were wrong.

Future features- We hope to have a more dynamically generated game library


## Study Page

This page contains the Katakana and Hirigana syllable charts for ease of view and studying. They also containg directions on stroke creation and flow of creating Kanji. 

Future features- We hope to implement either a dynamically interactive Charts with cliock funtions or a more feasible early term solution to be to add a space for interactive drawing with touch/mouse to practice drawing the kanji's
